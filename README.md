# LightsOutGame

A C# (WinForms) implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)">Lights Out</a> puzzle game.

This implementation does not feature set levels, on starting a new game the puzzle is randomised but will always be solvable. A best score (lowest number of moves) is recorded.

In the near future I plan to update this and add a solver.
